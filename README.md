# Password Generator Web Application

## This application considers special characters from the [list of password special characters found on the OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) as well the english alphabet in both lower and upper cases along with the numbers 0 to 9 in order to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters in length.

###The process follows these steps:
1. Prompt user for password length
2. Validate that user has provided an integer between 7 and 129
2. Prompt user to confirm inclusion of special characters
3. Prompt user to confirm inclusion of lowercase characters
4. Prompt user to confirm inclusion of uppercase characters
5. Prompt user to confirm inclusion of numerical charcters
6. Validate that use has selected at least one character type

Characters are then RANDOMLY selected and used to generate a password that meets the users selected criteria

The RANDOMLY generated password is then displayed to the user
